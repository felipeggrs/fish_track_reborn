# FISH TRACK REBORN

A fishing buff tracker for ArcheAge Classic. Displays fishing action buffs and timers directly on your target fish, making it easier to react to Strength Contest, Stand Firm, Reel In, and other fishing mechanics. Track multiple dead fish at once to maximize your fishing efficiency.

Reviving the work of Usb in the original Fish Track addon, but better than ever.

## New Features

- **Dual Icon Display** - Two icons shown side-by-side below the fish:
  - Action buff icon (Stand Firm, Reel In, Give Slack, Big Reel In) with green timer
  - Strength Contest icon with yellow timer

- **Dead Fish Timer** - Mark a fish with signs 1-6, and when it dies, a 180-second countdown timer appears at the center of your screen so you know when to collect it before it despawns.

- **Multiple Fish Tracking** - Track up to 6 dead fish simultaneously using different markers

## Usage

1. Target a fish to see buff icons and timers below it
2. Use in-game markers (1-6) on fish you want to track after death.
3. When a marked fish dies, target it once to start the death timer.
